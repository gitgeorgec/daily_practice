[767. Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/description/)

My first thought of this question is to sort the sting and split it into two substrings, then merge them one by one so the two adjacent are not the same. but it was wrong, since it may break into continued characters.  
The second thought is:

1. Sort the string.
2. Split it into two substrings `L1` and `L2`.
3. Init a combination `res` with `L1[0]`, pointer `left_p = 1, right_p = 0` .
4. Take turns on substrings, and check the head or tail value of the current combination. If the value is equal to both head and tail it is not possible to generate the result, we return an empty string. Otherwise, add it to `res`, and move the pointer to the next one.

```py
class Solution:
  def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
      characters = sorted(s)

      l = characters[:(len(s) + 1)//2]
      r = characters[(len(s) + 1)//2:]
      res = l[0]
      l_pointer = 1
      r_pointer = 0
      is_left = False

      while len(res) < len(s):
          if is_left:
              if res[-1] != l[l_pointer]:
                  res += l[l_pointer]
              elif res[0] != l[l_pointer]:
                  res = l[l_pointer] + res
              else:
                  return ''
              l_pointer += 1
          else:
              if res[-1] != r[r_pointer]:
                  res += r[r_pointer]
              elif res[0] != r[r_pointer]:
                  res = r[r_pointer] + res
              else:
                  return ''
              r_pointer += 1
          is_left = not is_left
      return res
```

the time complexity is O(N*logN) + O(N) = O(N*log(N)) since it need to sort the string first.

The editorial has two answers

1. Counting and Priority Queue O(NlogK)
2. Counting and Even/Odd O(N)

## docker

In `dockerfile` `ADD` and `COPY` can both copy a file into the container's file system, but `ADD` does more things, it allows src to be a URL.

## nginx

nginx will match the most match patterns, so if the result is not expected, check the pattern on the config, maybe it includes the other config that has more matching patterns.
