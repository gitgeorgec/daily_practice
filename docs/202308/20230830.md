[2366. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array/)

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumReplacement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]:
                continue

            num_elements = (nums[i] + nums[i+1] - 1) // nums[i + 1]

            ans += num_elements - 1

            nums[i] = nums[i] // num_elements

        return ans

## Nuxt3 page transition issue

I use the Nuxt3 page transition API on the BCM official website and wish to create an animation when the route changes. We found that if the network is not fast enough the background image of the page will transition to be next page before the animation. But if the background video is ready and played, the transition will not happen.  
So my solution is to save the origin page's background image and then show it when the page transitions.
