[86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/description/)

This is a link-list question. The idea is very simple, just create additional two link-list `larger_list` and `small_list`, then iterate through the origin list if the value is smaller than `x`, append it to the `small_list` else append it to the `larger_list`, and finally attach ` larger_list`` head to  `small_list`tail and return`small_list` head is the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        large = ListNode()
        small = ListNode()
        large_head = large
        small_head = small

        cur = head
        while cur:
            if cur.val >= x:
                large.next = cur
                large = large.next
            else:
                small.next = cur
                small = small.next
            cur = cur.next

        large.next = None
        small.next = large_head.next
        return small_head.next
```

Nuxt2 project `careers` facing memory leak issues.

try using `nuxt-memwatch` to find the problem.

using

```bash
ab -c100 -n100000 http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

to load test

use [nuxt-memwatch](https://github.com/pimlie/nuxt-memwatch), [node-menwatcher](https://github.com/pimlie/node-memwatcher) to watch memory change.
