## Leetcode daily

[1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/)

Today is a busy day, I don't have time to solve this hard problem.
This problem needs dynamic programming.

## Html video tag

If the the source is not completely downloading removing the video tag will not abort the download. So when the website has many auto-play videos on each page and the network connection is slow, navigating from page to page will trigger the video download and take the network resource, if not consumed quickly enough, it will eventually occupy all bandwidth and block the network.
