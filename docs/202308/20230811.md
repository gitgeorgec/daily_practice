[518. Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/description/)

I use depth-first search(dfs) and cache strategy first, but unfortunately, it does not work because it duplicates the counts of the combinations. For example, [1,1,2] should be the same as [1,2,1] and [2,1,1].

The first solution is using recursion and memoize, the key is that the current state depends on the index of current and the remaining amount, we should create 2D memo to store the numbers of ways to make up `j` using the coin of index `i`.

```py
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [[-1] * (amount + 1) for _ in range(len(coins))]
        def numOfWays(i, cur_amount):
            if cur_amount == 0:
                return 1

            if i == len(coins):
                return 0

            if dp[i][cur_amount] != -1:
                return dp[i][cur_amount]

            if coins[i] > cur_amount:
                dp[i][cur_amount] = numOfWays(i + 1, cur_amount)
            else:
                dp[i][cur_amount] = numOfWays(i + 1, cur_amount) + numOfWay(i, cur_amount - coins[i])

            return dp[i][cur_amount]
        return numOfWays(0, amount)
```

The second solution is quite the same, it uses dynamic programming. We consider the current state can be represented by the sum of previous states.
The base case is when the amount equals 0, it is one combination, so dp[0] = 1, Then we start iteration from the first coin, For each coin we fill up the value in dp from coin value to amount value, the value in dp (`dp[current]`) should be the sum of the previous dp by the key of amount value minus coin value (`dp[current - coin]`)

```py
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for coin in coins:
            for cur in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[cur] += dp[cur - coin]

        return dp[amount]
```

The time complexity is two for loop, it is O(len(coins) \* amount),  
The space complexity is the dp, so it is O(amount + 1).
