This is the second day of work note, keep going.

## Leetcode daily

[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/) Search in Rotated Sorted Array

this is a very annoying problem, the idea is simple just using binary search, but many cases need to figure out.
Overall, the process is first checking the mid, then checking if `mid > left`, and if true then checking the relation between the target, `left`, and mid. else checking the relation between the target, `right`, and mid to make sure to find the increasing order then can use the original binary search.

```py
class Solution:
  def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    l, r = 0, len(nums) -1

    while r >= l:
      m = (l + r)//2
      if nums[m] == target:
        return m

      if nums[m] >= nums[l]:
        if target >= nums[l] and target < nums[m]:
          r = m - 1
        else:
          l = m + 1
      else:
        if target <= nums[r] and target > nums[m]:
          l = m + 1
        else:
          r = m - 1
    return -1
```

## project notes meeting

To maintain projects, we want to create notes for every project.

## python django todo project setup

1. create virtual env, here I use `todo_backend` as the venv name.

```bash
python3 -m venv todo_backend
```

2. active the venv.

```bash
source ./todo_backend/bin/activate
```

3. install Django

```bash
pip3 install django
```

4. create Django project, here I use `backend` as the project name.

```bash
django-admin startproject backend
```

5. create an app inside the Django project, here I use `api` as the app name

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp api
```

the folder structure looks like this

```
- backend/
-- api/
-- backend/
-- manage.py
- todo_backend/
```

## frontend meeting

Css mask property issue, some devices fail to show the mask image, maybe because of the cors.
