[459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/)

My first naive solution is to check every possible substring from the beginning.

```py
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            part = s[:i]
            is_repeat = True
            for cur in s.split(part):
                if cur:
                   is_repeat = False
                   break
            if is_repeat:
                return True
        return False
```

It works, but it is very slow. Time complexity is O(n \* n)

Then I check the editorial, it provides two solutions. The first is just the opposite way of my solution, it first assumes the pattern, then multiple it to make the length equal to the `s` string then check if is equal, it true return true, else keeps updating the pattern until the length of the pattern is haft of `s` string, then return false.

```py
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(1, n//2 + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                pattern = s[:i] * (n // i)
                if s == pattern:
                    return True
        return False
```

It is faster, the time complexity is O(n \* (n^0.5)).

The other solution is a little tricky. It notes that `This is a very advanced approach and might not be expected in an interview.`  
The idea is `If a string can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together, it must be a rotation of itself.`
but it is inefficient to check all rotations if using a loop, the trick is to repeat the `s` then we can easily check the existence of every rotation.

```py
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        t = s + s
        if s in t[1:-1]:
            return True
        return False
```

The time complexity is O(n)
