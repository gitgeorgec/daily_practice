The problem needs some math, it is not simply base 26, because it starts from 1, the important point of this problem is that every column title has the corresponding column numbers as a number base 26 plus one.

```py
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        s = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        cur = columnNumber
        mods = []
        while cur:
            cur -= 1
            mod = cur % 26
            cur = cur // 26
            mods.append(mod)

        res = ''
        for m in mods:
            res = s[m] + res
        return res
```

sentry tracing can show the bottleneck of web performance.

## Nuxt3

Nuxt can set multiple render modes https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering using the `swr` setting can improve performance.
