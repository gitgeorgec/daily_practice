[225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

I have done the reverse question before (using stack to implement queue), so my first idea is that it can be solved with O(1) on push and pop methods. But I was wrong, it is not a proper solution for O(1), and it needs at least O(n) on one of the methods.
The idea is to rotate the queue items when a new value is appended.

```py
class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(x)
        for _ in range(len(self.queue) - 1):
            self.queue.append(self.queue.popleft())


    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.queue.popleft()


    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.queue[0]


    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.queue) == 0
```
