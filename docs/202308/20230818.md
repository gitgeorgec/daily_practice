[1615. Maximal Network Rank](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-network-rank/description/)

The idea is simple, first list all possible roads for every city and keep them in a dictionary, then paring the cities by two loops, plus the numbers of each city, but minus one if they connect each other. Update the answer with the max value and finally return the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def maximalNetworkRank(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        road_dict = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for road in roads:
            [a, b] = road
            road_dict[a].append(b)
            road_dict[b].append(a)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                total = len(road_dict[i]) + len(road_dict[j])
                if i in road_dict[j]:
                    total -= 1
                ans = max(total, ans)
        return ans
```

## Python

### defaultdict

It helps to create a dictionary, when visiting a not existing key, it will not get an error, instead, it creates a default value for you.

```py
list_dict = defaultdict(list)
list_dict[a].append(1) # this will atomic create a list even 'a' is not init before
```

## English

`neck of the woods` It is an idiom that means an area where one lives and knows well.
