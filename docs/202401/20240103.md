[Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-03)

The number of laser beams between two rows is the number of safety devices in the first row multiplied by the number of safety devices in the second row. If there is no safety device in that row, the laser beam can pass. So we can count the number of devices row by row in the iteration, record the number of devices in the previous row multiplied by the number of devices in the current row, add it to the result, and finally return the result as the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def numberOfBeams(self, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        prev = 0
        for row in bank:
            cur = row.count('1')
            res += prev * cur
            prev = cur if cur > 0 else prev
        return res
```

## BFE javascript coding question

[28. implement clearAllTimeout()](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-clearAllTimeout)

This is an interesting idea, since the timer ID is auto-increased by 1, we can set a new timer to check the current timer ID and set an iteration to clear every timer by reducing one to the ID.

```js
/**
 * cancel all timer from window.setTimeout
 */
function clearAllTimeout() {
  // your code here
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {}, 0);
  for (i = timer; i >= 0; i--) {
    clearTimeout(i);
  }
}
```
