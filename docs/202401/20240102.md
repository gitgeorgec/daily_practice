## Leetcode daily

[Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-an-array-into-a-2d-array-with-conditions/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-02)

Today's question is very straightforward, main idea is to use a hash map to count the number of appearance times and generate the answer for each row by the appearance times.

```py
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        size = 0
        for num in nums:
            counts[num] += 1
            size = max(size, counts[num])

        res = [[] for _ in range(size)]
        for num in counts:
            for i in range(counts[num]):
                res[i].append(num)
        return res
```

## BFE javascript coding question

[27. implement completeAssign()](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-completeAssign)

As the problem description says, this question test solely checks your understanding of how property descriptors work. the key idea is that `getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` will return ALL descriptors including Symbol & Enumerable & NON-Enumerable. We can use that and `defineProperties()` to solve the problem.

```js
function completeAssign(target, ...sources) {
  if (target === undefined || target === null) {
    throw Error();
  }
  // your code here
  target = Object(target);
  for (const source of sources) {
    if (
      source === undefined ||
      source === null ||
      (typeof source === "number" && isNaN(source))
    ) {
      continue;
    }
    Object.defineProperties(target, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(source));
  }
  return target;
}
```
