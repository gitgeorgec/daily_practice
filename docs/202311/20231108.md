[2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-a-cell-is-reachable-at-a-given-time/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-08)

This is an easy question, determine the distance between two point and check if it less than t, beware of the special edge case, we can solve the problem in 3 minutes.

```py
class Solution:
    def isReachableAtTime(self, sx: int, sy: int, fx: int, fy: int, t: int) -> bool:
        dx = abs(fx - sx)
        dy = abs(fy - sy)
        if dx == 0 and dy == 0 and t == 1:
            return False
        return t >= max(dx, dy)
```
