## Leetcode daily

[935. Knight Dialer](https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-27)

The idea is to maintain an array of size 10 since the number is 0 to 9, the index can represent the number directly, and the value in the array is how many paths end with the number, by summing up the value of the array we can get the answer, the process is  
1.) list each number's possible next moves,  
2.) then create a new array to record the sum of previous moves, iterate through 0 to 9 and add the possible counts to the new array, and update the new summed array as the maintained array for each iteration.  
3.) Summing up the maintained array will be the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def knightDialer(self, n: int) -> int:
        moves = [[4,6], [6,8], [7,9],[4,8],[0,3,9],[],[0,1,7],[2,6],[1,3],[2,4]]
        if n == 1:
            return 10
        curr = [1] * 10
        while n > 1:
            next_arr = [0] * 10
            for index, move in enumerate(moves):
                for dist in move:
                    next_arr[dist] += curr[index] % (10**9 + 7)
            n -= 1
            curr = next_arr

        return sum(curr) % (10**9 + 7)

## BFE javascript coding question

[6. implement basic debounce()](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-basic-debounce)

The idea is use timer to delay the function call, if call the function in the period of timer, we clear the timer and set a new one.

```js
/**
 * @param {(...args: any[]) => any} func
 * @param {number} wait
 * @returns {(...args: any[]) => any}
 */
function debounce(func, wait) {
  // your code here
  let timer;
  function debounced(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func(...args);
      timer = null;
    }, wait);
  }
  return debounced;
}
```
