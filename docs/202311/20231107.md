This question is more like a math problem, writing down the code step-by-step by fellow the problem description can get the answer straight.

```py
class Solution:
    def eliminateMaximum(self, dist: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(dist)
        t = [dist[i]/speed[i] for i in range(n)]
        t.sort()
        time = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if time < t[i]:
                time += 1
            else:
                return time
        return time
```
