[1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-24)

This is an easy problem, there is a funny comment that says `Thank you for an easy question so I can quickly go back to my Thanksgiving dinner.`
We can first sort the piles and then simulate the process, since every loop we can get the second best coins, we just select the first two piles and the last one pile then add the second pile coin to the answer, and after that return the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:
        piles.sort()
        res = 0
        l, r = 0, len(piles)
        while r > l:
            r -= 2
            l += 1
            res += piles[r]
        return res
```

## BEF javascript coding question

[5. implement throttle() with leading & trailing option](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-throttle-with-leading-and-trailing-option)

This is an extended question for yesterday's `implement base throttle()`, we can add the condition before the function call to reach the requirement.

```js
function throttle(func, wait, option = { leading: true, trailing: true }) {
  // your code here
  let lastArgs;
  let timer;
  const { leading, trailing } = option;
  function setTimer() {
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      timer = null;
      if (lastArgs && trailing) {
        func(...lastArgs);
        setTimer();
        lastArgs = undefined;
      }
    }, wait);
  }
  function throttled(...args) {
    if (!timer) {
      if (leading) {
        func(...args);
      }
      setTimer();
    } else {
      if (trailing) {
        lastArgs = args;
      }
    }
  }
  return throttled;
}
```
