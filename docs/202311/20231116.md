[1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-unique-binary-string/submissions/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-16)

I think this question is test about how you understand the binary api, once you master it, it should be easy to solve this question. My idea is covert numbers to decimal and iterate from 0 to 2^n find the number not in the target and return it.

```py
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(nums[0])
        nums_set = set()
        for num in nums:
            nums_set.add(int(num, 2))

        for i in range(2**n):
            if i not in nums_set:
                res = bin(i)[2:]
                return '0' * (n - len(res)) + res
```
