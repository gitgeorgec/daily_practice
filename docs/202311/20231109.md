[1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-homogenous-substrings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-09)

My idea is to start from the end of the string and iterate to the start, every `i`'s possible combination will start from `i` and end with the same character, for example
[z,z,z,z,z], the index `2` possible will be 'z', 'zz','zzz' 3 combination, which is added the last one('zzz') to the previous combination ('zz', 'z'), so we can get the algorism below.

```py
class Solution:
    def countHomogenous(self, s: str) -> int:
        counts = [1] * len(s)
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(len(s) - 2, -1, -1):
            cur = s[i]
            pre = s[i + 1]
            if cur == pre:
                counts[i] += counts[i + 1]
        return sum(counts)% mod
```
