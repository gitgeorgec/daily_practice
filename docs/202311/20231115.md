[1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging
](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-element-after-decreasing-and-rearranging/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-15)

First, we rearrange the arr by order, then we can implement the second rule to satisfy the requirement, we can init the answer to 0, then iterate through the arr and increase the answer by one if the current value is larger than the answer because we can reduce the value to `answer + 1`, so after the iteration we can return the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        arr.sort()
        ans = 0
        for val in arr:
            if val > ans:
                ans+=1

        return ans
```
