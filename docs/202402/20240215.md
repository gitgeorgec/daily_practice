[Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-polygon-with-the-largest-perimeter/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-15)

My first Idea is to sort the input numbers and then use DFS and a cache to find all possible combinations and find the maximum sum of the combinations, the solution is working but it takes too much time.
The working solution is using prefix sum with sorted input numbers, checking the prefix sum with the number of the next index of input one by one, and if the sum is larger than the number, we can say we found the max number. if none of the numbers fit the condition, we return -1.

```py
class Solution:
    def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        cur = 0
        prefix_sum = []
        for num in nums:
            cur += num
            prefix_sum.append(cur)

        for i in range(len(prefix_sum) -2, -1, -1):
            if prefix_sum[i] > nums[i + 1]:
                return prefix_sum[i] + nums[i + 1]
        return -1
```
