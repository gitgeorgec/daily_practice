[746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-10-13)

This is a dp question, we can see that the current position cost can be determined by the min of the previous two steps, so updating the current cost one by one and returning the min of the last two will be the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(2, len(cost)):
            cost[i] = cost[i] + min(cost[i - 1], cost[i - 2])
        return min(cost[-1], cost[-2])
```

## JS cool knowledge

setTimeout can use to eval string

```js
setTimeout("alert(1)");
```
