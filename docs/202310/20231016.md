[119. Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-10-16)

Today we have a simple question, given a row index and return the row of pascals-triangle. The naive solution uses recursion for index 0 to target index and follows the rule of pascals-triangle to generate the row.

```py
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        pre = [1, 1]
        if rowIndex == 0:
            return [1]
        if rowIndex == 1:
            return [1,1]
        curIndex = 1
        while curIndex != rowIndex:
            cur = [1] * (len(pre) + 1)
            for i in range(1,len(cur) -1):
                cur[i] = pre[i - 1] + pre[i]
            pre = cur
            curIndex += 1
        return cur
```

the time complexity is `O(n!)`. the better solution is using the math definition of pascals-triangle, the row item can be calculated from top-down
