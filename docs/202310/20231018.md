(2050. Parallel Courses III)[https://leetcode.com/problems/parallel-courses-iii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-10-18]

The course question is normally related to Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting.
My first idea is bfs and update the time, but got timeout for the test.

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:
        ## first through
        # generate graph
        # find the node that have no child as start
        # start bfs find the parent node with no parent and update the time
        # return the sum of min of all layer's parent node time will be the answer

        parents_to_children = collections.defaultdict(set)
        children_to_parents = collections.defaultdict(set)

        for r in relations:
            [p, c] = r
            parents_to_children[p].add(c)
            children_to_parents[c].add(p)

        start = []
        end = []
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1,n + 1):
            # find the node with no children
            if not parents_to_children[i]:
                end.append(i)
            if not children_to_parents[i]:
                start.append(i)
        new_time = [t for t in time]
        while start:
            next_start = []
            for p in start:
                for c in parents_to_children[p]:
                    new_time[c -1] = max(new_time[c-1], time[c -1] + new_time[p-1])
                    next_start.append(c)
            start = next_start
        # print(new_time)
        for e in end:
            ans = max(ans, new_time[e -1])

        return ans
```

The solution, using Kahn's Algorithm

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        indegree = [0] * n

        for (x, y) in relations:
            graph[x - 1].append(y - 1)
            indegree[y - 1] += 1

        queue = deque()
        max_time = [0] * n
        for node in range(n):
            if indegree[node] == 0:
                queue.append(node)
                max_time[node] = time[node]

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                max_time[neighbor] = max(max_time[neighbor], max_time[node] + time[neighbor])
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return max(max_time)
```

But I found that dfs + cache is more easy to understand

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:
        @cache
        def dfs(node):
            if not graph[node]:
                return time[node]

            ans = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                ans = max(ans, dfs(neighbor))

            return time[node] + ans

        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for (x, y) in relations:
            graph[x - 1].append(y - 1)

        ans = 0
        for node in range(n):
            ans = max(ans, dfs(node))

        return ans
```
