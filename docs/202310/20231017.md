[1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-tree-nodes/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-10-17)

I totally miss understand this question, I went so wrong. After understand the question, I find out that the question is simple dfs or bfs question.

```py
class Solution:
    def validateBinaryTreeNodes(self, n: int, leftChild: List[int], rightChild: List[int]) -> bool:
        def findRoot():
            # the root has no parent - this also means that the root is not the child of any nodes.
            children = set(leftChild) | set(rightChild)

            for i in range(n):
                if i not in children:
                    return i
            return -1

        root = findRoot()
        if root == -1:
            return False
        visited = {root}
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            cur = stack.pop()
            left = leftChild[cur]
            right = rightChild[cur]
            for child in [left, right]:
                if child != -1:
                    if child in visited:
                        return False
                    stack.append(child)
                    visited.add(child)

        return len(visited) == n
```
