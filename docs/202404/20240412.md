[Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-12)

This is hard.

Since the water limit is controlled by the smaller side of the wall, the idea is to use two pointers `l,r`, and two variables `max_l, max_r` to record the maxima value to process the smaller side situation at each iteration, if the current height is larger than the max value in the record, update to max value else add the difference to the `ans` and move the pointer forward or backward depending on the side, after the iteration the `ans` is the trapping rainwater.

```py
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        res = 0
        max_l, max_r = 0, 0
        while l < r:
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                if height[l] > max_l:
                    max_l = height[l]
                else:
                    res += max_l - height[l]
                l += 1
            else:
                if height[r] >= max_r:
                    max_r = height[r]
                else:
                    res += max_r - height[r]
                r -= 1
        return res
```
