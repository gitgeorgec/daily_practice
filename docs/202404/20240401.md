[Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-01)

This is a simple question, starting from the end of the input, init the answer as 0, if the char is not white space, we add one to the answer, else we return the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        start = False
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == ' ' and start == True:
                return count
            if s[i] !=  ' ':
                start = True
            if start:
                count += 1
        return count
```
