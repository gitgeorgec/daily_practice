[Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-18)

The idea is that a square has four sides and if a square is connected to another square it removes a side, so we check each island and first assume it has four sides and then check if it is connected in four directions to another square if it does, we subtract 1 from the side length and add that to the result, and once the iteration is complete, the result is the perimeter of the island.

```py
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        dir = [(1,0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        for row in range(len(grid)):
            for col in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[row][col] == 1:
                    side = 4
                    for (x, y) in dir:
                        if row + x >= 0 and row + x < len(grid) and col + y >= 0 and col + y < len(grid[0]) and grid[row + x][col + y] == 1:
                            side -= 1
                    ans += side
        return ans
```
