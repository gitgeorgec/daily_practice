[Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-08)

Just simulate the process and record the iteration times, once the times are equal to the number of students means that all students in the queue do not like the current sandwich, we return the count as the number of students unable to eat lunch.

```py
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[int], sandwiches: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        while True:
            if students[0] == sandwiches[0]:
                students.pop(0)
                sandwiches.pop(0)
                count = 0
            else:
                count += 1
                students.append(students.pop(0))
            if count == len(students):
                return count

```
