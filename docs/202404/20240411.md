[Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-11)

I had solve this question before, but I can't solve this by myself this time. wtf!!

We use monotonic stack and a counter to solve this problem, first init a stack and a counter to 0, iterate through the input string, in each iteration loop check if current number is smaller than the top item of stack and count not equal to k, if true pop from the stack and add count by 1, and then append current number to the stack if current number is not zero.
After the iteration join the stack is the answer, but also consider the edge case of empty string and count not equal to k,
if result is empty string return '0' as the answer, if count not equal to k means the reset number is increasing order, so we can remove the last (k - count) items then join the stack as string to be the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        count = 0
        for c in num:
            while stack and count != k and int(c) < int(stack[-1]):
                stack.pop()
                count += 1
            if stack or c != '0':
                stack.append(c)

        if count != k:
            return ''.join(stack[0: -k + count]) if stack[0: -k + count] else '0'

        return ''.join(stack) if stack else '0'
```
