[Time Needed to Buy Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-09)

Simulate the process, init a counter `time` to record passed time, For every iteration we minus one to the value of the current index, plus one to the `time`, once the index `k` is zero, return `time` as the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        time = 0
        n = len(tickets)
        while tickets[k] > 0:
            for i in range(n):
                if tickets[i] > 0:
                    time += 1
                    tickets[i] -= 1
                    if i == k and tickets[i] == 0:
                        return time
        return time
```
