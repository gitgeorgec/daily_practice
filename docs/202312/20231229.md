[Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-29)

Today's question is a hard one, I was only able to write a timeout solution for it, use the same idea as yesterday, create a decision recursion, and use a memo cache to reduce the calculations.

```py
class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(jobDifficulty)
        if n < d:
            return -1
        memo = {}
        def count(index, total, today_max, left):
            if left <= 0:
                return float("inf")
            key = (index, left)
            if key in memo:
                return memo[key]
            if index == n - 1:
                if left == 1:
                    return total + today_max
                else:
                    return float("inf")
            work = count(index + 1, total, max(today_max, jobDifficulty[index +1]), left)
            rest = count(index + 1, total + today_max, jobDifficulty[index + 1], left - 1)
            res = min(work, rest)
            memo[key] = res
            return res

        return count(0, 0, jobDifficulty[0], d)
```

The workable solution idea is the same as mine, but it reduces the variable and calculates it at every iteration.

```py
import functools
class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(jobDifficulty)
        if n < d:
            return -1

        @functools.lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, left):
            if left == 1:
                return max(jobDifficulty[i:])
            res, maxd = float('inf'), 0
            for j in range(i, n - left + 1):
                maxd = max(maxd, jobDifficulty[j])
                res = min(res, maxd + dfs(j + 1, left - 1))
            return res
        return dfs(0, d)
```

## Python lru_cache

Python has build in lru cache, can be import by `functools`.
