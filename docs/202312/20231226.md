[1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-26)

I used recursion and memo to solve this problem, we can do recursion using the helper function, in the helper function we first set the initial condition, if the round is equal to "1" and if "goal" is greater than `k` it means the answer cannot be generated so return 0, otherwise return 1; if we have more rounds than "1", we initialize "total" to 0, then iterate from 1 to "k" and use the new parameters to reduce the rounds by 1 and the target by the current iteration's index and adds it to "total", then returns the total as the answer.
The idea works, but not very efficient because we do a lot of recalculations, so we add a memo in the helper function to cache the results of the current turn and the current target, and if we find the key in the memo, we return the results immediately so that we can resolve the issue within the stipulated time.

```py
class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, k: int, target: int) -> int:
        m = 10**9 + 7
        cache = {}

        def recursion(cur_round, cur_target):
            if cur_round == 1:
                if cur_target > k:
                    return 0
                else:
                    return 1
            if (cur_round, cur_target) in cache:
                return cache[(cur_round, cur_target)]

            total = 0
            next_round = cur_round - 1
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                next_target = cur_target - i
                if next_target > 0:
                    total += recursion(next_round, next_target)
            cache[(cur_round, cur_target)] = total
            return total

        return recursion(n, target) % m
```
