[1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-21)

After reading the problem, we found that the Y value has nothing to do with the solution to this problem, so we sorted the points according to the X value. The maximum difference between each neighbor is the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        area = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            area = max(area, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0])
        return area
```
