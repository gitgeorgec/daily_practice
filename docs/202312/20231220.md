Leetcode has given a lot of simple questions recently. My first reaction was that Leetcode employees must be on vacation or something, but after reading the editorial part, I discovered that every simple problem has an optimized solution that reduces the time complexity by one level. I was wrong, they are very dedicated and put a lot of effort into this.

## Leetcode daily

[2706. Buy Two Chocolates](https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-20)

The question can be solved by sorting the list and returning the money minus the first two prices; if the leftover is less than 0, return the original money.
The point is to find the two minimal numbers in the prices, sort is a simple way, but it takes O(n\*logn) time, the other way is to track the minimal in loop, which can reduce the time complexity to O(n).

the greatest achievement is that
In Garena I have complete many projects, and serve million of user, and all the site I build is working stable and none cause any incident

my strength is that I am flexiable

```py
class Solution:
    def buyChoco(self, prices: List[int], money: int) -> int:
        first_cheap = 100
        second_cheap = 100
        for price in prices:
            if price < second_cheap and price < first_cheap:
                second_cheap = first_cheap
                first_cheap = price
            elif price < second_cheap:
                second_cheap = price
        leftover = money - first_cheap - second_cheap

        if leftover >= 0:
            return leftover
        return money
```

## BFE javascript coding question

[24. create a Priority Queue in JavaScript](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-priority-queue-in-JavaScript)

This is not an easy task, I make a lot of small error during coding, really need to be careful of detail and think clear.

```js
class PriorityQueue {
  /**
   * @param {(a: any, b: any) => -1 | 0 | 1} compare -
   * compare function, similar to parameter of Array.prototype.sort
   */
  constructor(compare) {
    this.compare = (a, b) => compare(a, b) > 0;
    this.heap = [];
  }

  /**
   * return {number} amount of items
   */
  size() {
    return this.heap.length;
  }

  /**
   * returns the head element
   */
  peek() {
    return this.heap[0];
  }

  /**
   * @param {any} element - new element to add
   */
  add(element) {
    this.heap.push(element);
    let curIdx = this.size() - 1;
    while (true) {
      if (curIdx === 0) return element;
      const parentIdx = Math.floor((curIdx - 1) / 2);
      if (this.compare(this.heap[parentIdx], element)) {
        this._swap(parentIdx, curIdx);
        curIdx = parentIdx;
      } else {
        return element;
      }
    }
  }

  /**
   * remove the head element
   * @return {any} the head element
   */
  poll() {
    if (this.size() === 0) {
      return undefined; // Return undefined or handle the empty queue case
    }

    this._swap(0, this.size() - 1);
    const head = this.heap.pop();

    let curIdx = 0;

    while (true) {
      const element = this.heap[curIdx];
      const leftIdx = curIdx * 2 + 1;
      const rightIdx = curIdx * 2 + 2;

      let childIndex = null;

      if (leftIdx < this.size() && this.compare(element, this.heap[leftIdx])) {
        childIndex = leftIdx;
      }

      if (
        rightIdx < this.size() &&
        this.compare(element, this.heap[rightIdx]) &&
        this.compare(this.heap[leftIdx], this.heap[rightIdx])
      ) {
        childIndex = rightIdx;
      }

      if (childIndex !== null) {
        this._swap(curIdx, childIndex);
        curIdx = childIndex;
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    return head;
  }

  _swap(idx1, idx2) {
    [this.heap[idx1], this.heap[idx2]] = [this.heap[idx2], this.heap[idx1]];
  }
}

const pq = new PriorityQueue((a, b) => a - b);
pq.add(5);
pq.add(3);
pq.add(1);
pq.add(4);
pq.add(2);
const result = [];
while (pq.size() > 0) {
  result.push(pq.poll());
}
console.log(result); //[1,2,3,4,5]
```
