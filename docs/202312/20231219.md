## Leetcode daily

[661. Image Smoother](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-19)

Today's questions were not difficult, but the instructions were vague. I would like to vote a thumb down on today's question. The solution is simple, adding the neighbor values to the elements and taking the average solves the problem.

```py
class Solution:
    def imageSmoother(self, img: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(img)
        m = len(img[0])
        ans = [[0 for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
        def get_value(S, i, j):
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= n or j >= m:
                return None
            return S[i][j]
        smoother = [(1,-1), (1, 0), (1,1), (0, -1), (0,0),(0, 1),(-1,-1), (-1, 0),(-1,1)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                count = 0
                for (x, y) in smoother:
                    val = get_value(img, i + x, j + y)
                    if val != None:
                        count += 1
                        ans[i][j] += val
                ans[i][j] = ans[i][j]//count

        return ans
```

## BFE javascript coding question

[23. create a sum()](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-sum)

This is a tricky question that tests our understanding of JavaScript's "type coercion". For this problem, we want to return a function that can be called and, when compared to a number, convert it to a number. Therefore, we have to override the valueOf method of this function.

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num
 */
function sum(num) {
  // your code here
  function ans(num2) {
    return sum(num + num2);
  }
  ans.valueOf = () => num;

  return ans;
}
const sum1 = sum(1);
sum1(2) == 3; // true
sum1(3) == 4; // true
sum(1)(2)(3) == 6; // true
sum(5)(-1)(2) == 6; // true
```
