[1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/element-appearing-more-than-25-in-sorted-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-11)

Since the array is sorted, we can use a window with a length of 25% to cover the condition, start iterating through the array with the window, check if the first element and the last element are equal in the window, and return the first element which meets that condition.

```py
class Solution:
    def findSpecialInteger(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)//4
        for i in range(len(arr) - n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i + n]:
                return arr[i]

```

## BFE javascript coding question

[16. create an Event Emitter](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Event-Emitter)

My idea is to use a hashMap to record the subscribes, and event name as key, and use an array as value to store the callback functions. To remove the callback we can set the function to null, to locate which function should be released we can use the index of the function that was stored when the release function was created.

```js
// please complete the implementation
class EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    this.events = {};
  }
  subscribe(eventName, callback) {
    const events = this.events;
    if (events[eventName]) {
      events[eventName].push(callback);
    } else {
      events[eventName] = [callback];
    }
    const index = events[eventName].length - 1;
    return {
      release: () => {
        events[eventName][index] = null;
      },
    };
  }

  emit(eventName, ...args) {
    const events = this.events[eventName] || [];
    events.forEach((cb) => {
      if (cb) {
        cb.apply(this, args);
      }
    });
  }
}
```
