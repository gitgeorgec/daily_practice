This question is hard, I only work on the first step, which is generate the graph map for the tickets. sort the list by a
The after process are start with 'JFK', check the destination with dfs and find the answer

```py
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for [s, e] in tickets:
            graph[s].append(e)

        for node in graph.values():
            node.sort()
        for node in graph.values():
            node.reverse()
        ans = []
        def visit(cur):
            while graph[cur]:
                visit(graph[cur].pop())
            ans.append(cur)
        visit('JFK')
        ans.reverse()

        return ans
```
