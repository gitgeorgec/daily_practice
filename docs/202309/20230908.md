## some thought

I saw an article on PTT talks about that why we humans need environmental protection. Its idea is not about sympathy for wild animals or the earth is sicking bullshit, environmental protection is all about humans, we protect the environment because we need it. Humans as a species are weak, we can not afford the huge change to the temperature and dirty water or air, Even worse, human society is weaker than the human body. So environmental protection helps us to maintain our survivor status till our tech is strong enough to handle any change from our environment.

```py
class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = [[1]]
        numRows -=1
        while numRows:
            cur = [1]
            for i in range(len(ans[-1])):
               res = ans[-1][i] + (ans[-1][i + 1] if i + 1 < len(ans[-1]) else 0)
               cur.append(res)
            ans.append(cur)
            numRows -= 1

        return ans

```
