[138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

Today's problem is a Listed-list type question. Just make sure the pointer and cache are clear, the problem is simple. First, clone a link list by iterating through the origin list, The key here is while each step we also record the Node and the copy relationship in a hashmap, and then we handle the random pointer by iterating through the origin list again, this time each step we use the hashmap we create to retrieve the cloned node, in the end return the clone list head we solve the problem.

```py
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        cur = head
        clone = Node(0)
        dummy = clone
        cache = { None: None }

        while cur:
            clone.next = Node(cur.val)
            clone = clone.next
            cache[cur] = clone
            cur = cur.next

        cur = head
        clone = dummy.next

        while cur:
            clone.random = cache[cur.random]
            clone = clone.next
            cur = cur.next

        return dummy.next
```

## git ssh issue
Our Gitlab domain has changed recently, the `ssh` config needs to be updated as well in the `~/.ssh/`config` by adding the below code to set the new Host and IdentityFile.
```
Host gitlab.garena.com
  Hostname gitlab.garena.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_gitlab_cn
```

can use the command 
```
ssh -Tv git@gitlab.garena.com
``` 
to debug the process of ssh to the git repository.
