[92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-07)

Today is a linked list problem again, it is also simple as long as we understand how to reverse a linked list and save the previous node and pointer properly, this problem can be solved.

```py
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        cur = head
        pre = dummy

        for _ in range(left - 1):
            cur = cur.next
            pre = pre.next

        reverse_pre = pre
        reverse_tail = cur
        next_node = None
        for _ in range(left, right + 1):
            next_node = cur.next
            cur.next, pre = pre, cur
            cur = next_node

        reverse_pre.next = pre
        reverse_tail.next = cur

        return dummy.next
```

## JS coding question

[2. implement curry() with placeholder support](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-curry-with-placeholder)

This is a very difficult question, you have to understand `arguments` very well to solve the problem.
My first idea was to store the incoming arguments in the closure and update it with the curried function, but it failed in some cases since all return functions reference the same stored value.
The solution is first to check the arguments meet the original function requirements, if true, return the execution result, else replace the placeholder with the new arguments in the return function

```js
function curry(fn) {
  const n = fn.length;
  const context = this;
  function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= n && !args.slice(0, n).includes(curry.placeholder)) {
      return fn.apply(context, args);
    }

    return (...newArgs) => {
      const res = args.map((arg) =>
        arg === curry.placeholder && newArgs.length ? newArgs.shift() : arg
      );
      return curried(...res, ...newArgs);
    };
  }

  return curried;
}
curry.placeholder = Symbol();

function join(a, b, c) {
  return `${a}_${b}_${c}`;
}
const _ = curry.placeholder;
const curriedJoin = curry(join);
console.log(curriedJoin(1, 2, 3)); // '1_2_3'
console.log(curriedJoin(_, 2)(1, 3)); // '1_2_3'
console.log(curriedJoin(_, _, _)(1)(_, 3)(2)); // '1_2_3'
console.log(curriedJoin(_, _, 3, 4)(1, _)(2, 5)); // 1_2_3
```

## docker expose VS. ports

In Docker, both `ports` and `expose` are used for networking and controlling how services running in containers can communicate with the outside world or with other containers, but they serve slightly different purposes.

`ports` are used to map container ports to host ports, making services accessible externally, while `expose` is used to document which ports are intended for internal communication between containers and do not directly affect external access.

```yml
ports:
  - "host-ports:container-ports"
```
