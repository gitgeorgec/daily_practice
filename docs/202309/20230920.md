It's getting close to travel, I am a little bit nervous. Today maybe is not a good day to work.

## Leetcode daily

[1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-20)

I not really solve this, I peak the answer. It needs some math idea and sliding window technic, reverse thinking of the target, the problem become simple.

```py
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        target = -x
        n = len(nums)
        for num in nums:
            target += num
        if target == 0:
            return n

        l = 0
        cur = 0
        total_len = 0
        for r in range(n):
            cur += nums[r]

            while r >= l and cur > target:
                cur -= nums[l]
                l += 1

            if cur == target:
                total_len = max(total_len, r - l + 1)

        return -1 if total_len == 0 else n - total_len
