[287. Find the Duplicate Number
](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-19)

This question looks very simple, but with the condition that can't use extra memory space, the question becomes a little bit difficult.
The idea is to use the property that numbers are unique and start from 0 to total length - 1, so every number in the given list can be seen as the index of the list when looping through the list and using the number as an index, then update the number in that index to a negative number, if the number is already negative, it means that is has changed before, so that index is the repeated value, which is the answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for num in nums:
            idx = abs(num)
            if nums[idx] < 0:
                return idx
            nums[idx] = -nums[idx]
        return -1
```
