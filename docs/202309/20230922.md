[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-22)

Easy question, just use an index to track current character position and loop through the string, if meet the same character plus index by one, after finish the loop, check if the index larger than the length of target.

```py
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        idx = 0
        cur = s[idx]
        for char in t:
            if char == cur:
                if idx < len(s) - 1:
                    idx += 1
                    cur = s[idx]
                else:
                    return True
