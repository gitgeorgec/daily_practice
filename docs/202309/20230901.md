[338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

This problem can be simply solved by Python build-in function bin (change num to binary format) and count (count certain target appearance times)

```py
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        return [bin(i).count('1') for i in range(n + 1)]
```

Time complexity is O(n _ len(every binary length)), which become O(n _ n)

but the description forbids that, so the other solution is dynamic programming.

```py
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        counter = [0]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            counter.append(counter[i >> 1] + i %2)
        return counter
```

## binary operator

Right shift(>>) Light shift(<<)  
Each shift to the left doubles the number, therefore each left shit multiple the original number by 2.

```py
# 000100 right shift 1 will be 000010 it means half the number
# 000100 left shift 1 will be 001000 it means double the number
```
