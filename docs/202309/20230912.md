[1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-12)

Today's question is simply data processing, using set and hashmap with some loops can simply solve the problem.

```py
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        charCount = Counter(s)
        countSet = set()
        ans = 0
        for val in charCount.values():
            while val > 0 and val in countSet:
                ans += 1
                val -= 1
            countSet.add(val)

        return ans
```
