## Leetcode daily

[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

This is a classical question using a fast and slow pointer to check if is circle exists in the linked list.

```py
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        fast = head
        slow = head
        while fast:
            if fast.next and fast.next.next:
                fast = fast.next.next
            else:
                return False

            slow = slow.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        return False

```
